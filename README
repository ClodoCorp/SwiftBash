SwiftBash: bash interface to OpenStack Swift
======================================================================

DESCRIPTION
===========
SwiftBash is a bash functions library which provides access to Clodo
Cloud Storage (http://www.clodo.ru/cloud-storage/review/) and any
other OpenStack Swift (http://swift.openstack.org/) compatible
storage, like Rackspace Cloud Files.

This library is not intended to be the full API implementation but a
set of handy functions for everyday use in scripts.

REQUIREMENTS
============
curl (tested on 7.21.0)
mktemp (any)
bash (tested on 4.1)
grep
sed
cut

Operating Systems
=================
Should work on any unix-like OS with tools listed in requirements.
I use it on Debian GNU/Linux stable (6.0) and testing distributions.

INSTALL
=======
Just put it where you can source it from later.

USAGE
======
Helper scripts:
Both uploader.sh and deleter.sh require username and secret key to
access the storage in  $STORAGE_USER and $STORAGE_KEY variables
respectively. You may create file ~/.swiftbash.sh and declare them
there like this:

realloc@motoko:~/projects/SwiftBash$ cat ~/.swiftbash.sh 
STORAGE_USER='storage_6681_1'
STORAGE_KEY='62027a8e6n29ft3b00d586fb7865f22b'

Make sure access permissions on that file meet your security needs.
Helper scripts will source that file and use provided credentials to
access your cloud storage.

Run test.sh to make sure that everything works.

realloc@motoko:~/projects/clodo/SwiftBash$ ./test.sh 2>test.log
